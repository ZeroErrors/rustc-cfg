## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Parse target_vendor. `Cfg` now has a new `target_vendor` field.

## [v0.1.1] - 2016-09-15

### Changed

- `Cfg::new` now prefers shelling out to RUSTC, if set, instead of `rustc`. Rationale: Cargo passes
  this variable to build scripts with the path to the `rustc` that used to build the build script,
  which may not match the `rustc` in `PATH`.
  
## v0.1.0 - 2016-09-10

- Initial release
